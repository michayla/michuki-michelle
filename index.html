                <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>My name is Michelle Wanjiku Michuki.I was born on September 4TH 2000.
    I just finished my high school last year my school was the best it helped me to get to where I am currently.
    Currently I have no job experience but I have done community service at Mariah Immaculata hospital.
    This helped in building my people skills.
    I have always been curious about how servers work and how I can be able to secure my server and the people around me.
<h3>Education</h3>
     <ul>2011-2015:I did my primary education at Little friends Academy</ul>
     <ul> 2016-2019: I did my high school at Bristar girls High school</ul>


</p>
<p>I learnt of Moringa from a friend. The reason why I joined Moringa is because even though I know nothing about coding I have that great urge to know how to code and be able to impact the people around me and be able to teach others around me. </p>
