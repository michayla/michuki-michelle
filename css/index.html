<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My full names are Michelle Wanjiku Michuki.
    I just finished my high school last year my school was the best it helped me to get to where I am currently.
    Currently I have no job experience but I have done community service at Mariah Immaculata hospital.
    This helped in building my people skills.
    I have always been curious about how servers work and how I can be able to secure my server and the people around me.
